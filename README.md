# Hi, I'm Aleksandr

Backend / Web3 Engineer focused on EVM infrastructure and real-time
on-chain systems.

I have 15+ years of software development experience, including 5+ years
in blockchain and crypto. My core expertise is in real-time transaction
processing, EVM decoding, DeFi mechanics, and monitoring infrastructure.

I build systems that analyze blocks, trace transactions, detect whale
activity, and execute on-chain strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Competencies

### Programming

-   TypeScript
-   JavaScript (ES6+)
-   Solidity

### EVM & Web3

-   viem / ethers.js 6
-   JSON-RPC, debug_traceTransaction
-   EVM transaction decoding (logs, calldata, internal calls)
-   Multinode RPC handling & fault tolerance
-   Gas model & execution flow understanding

### DeFi & Trading Logic

-   Uniswap-style AMMs (v2/v3 mechanics)
-   Multi-hop swaps
-   Arbitrage logic (triangular strategies)
-   Slippage control & liquidity analysis
-   MEV awareness (private RPC, bundle relays)

### Smart Contract Development

-   Solidity architecture
-   Router integrations
-   Custom errors & gas considerations
-   Reentrancy awareness
-   Static analysis (Slither)

### Infrastructure & Tooling

-   MySQL / SQLite
-   Event-driven architectures
-   Telegram bots & notification systems
-   Git
-   WebStorm

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Selected Work

### EVM Wallet Monitoring Infrastructure

Production-oriented transaction monitoring system:

- Multinode RPC consensus
- Fast / full decoding pipeline
- Internal call tracing
- Deterministic message updates
- Bounded deduplication

### Triangle Arbitrage Smart Contract

- On-chain swap execution via DEX routers
- Slippage protection
- Profit validation before execution
- Structured event logging

### EVM Bytecode Decompiler

Custom bytecode decompiler for EVM contracts:

- Opcode parser and stack analysis
- Control-flow reconstruction
- Symbolic tracking of storage and calldata
- Useful in audits, investigations, and reverse engineering
- Integrates with viem / EVM tooling workflows

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Engineering Approach

-   Prefer modular, layered architectures
-   Design for fault tolerance and idempotency
-   Consider gas efficiency and execution guarantees
-   Explicitly document trade-offs and limitations
-   Focus on deterministic behavior in distributed systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

-   Freelance / self-employed since 2010
-   Delivered 50+ crypto-related projects (bots, analyzers, contracts)
-   Worked under NDA agreements (code ownership transferred)

Currently transitioning from solo work into collaborative product teams.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What I'm Looking For

Remote role in:

-   Web3 backend
-   DeFi infrastructure
-   On-chain analytics
-   Trading / monitoring systems

Open to junior or middle positions to integrate into a strong
engineering team and grow within structured development environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Availability

-   Full-time remote
-   Flexible schedule
-   Comfortable working across time zones

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## English

-   Intermediate
-   Strong technical reading & writing
-   Actively improving spoken communication

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

I actively use modern tooling to improve productivity and code quality,
but all architectural decisions and final implementations are reviewed
and understood at a systems level.

Open to discussions, technical interviews, and practical test tasks.
